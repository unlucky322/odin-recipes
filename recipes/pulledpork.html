    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to serve the shredded pork on toasted buttered rolls. </p>

    <p>
        Making barbecue-restaurant-worthy pulled pork is easier to make than you think. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker. </li>
        <li><strong>Pork:</strong> If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.  </li>
        <li><strong>Sauces:</strong> You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple cider vinegar:</strong> Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors. </li>
        <li><strong>Broth:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme. </li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Buns and butter:</strong> You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make</h2>
